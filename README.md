## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Flexbox
- BEM pattern
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried to complete this challenge not longer than a month ago and fail completely. I could have not figure out how to structure the layout so everything works nice and is responsive. I moved to other challenges to learn more about creating design and today here I am back! I had a chance to prove myself the progress in CSS layouts. The challenge did not took me long to finish and I had an opportunity to master Flexbox and work with background images once again. First time I approached building HTML structure from the smallest components and it worked for me fine this time.

### Useful resources
